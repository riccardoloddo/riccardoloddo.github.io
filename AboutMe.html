    <h1>Life</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I grew up in a small village in Milan on October 14th 1999. When I was younger I had many passions, some have remained while others have been lost.
       I did swimming, basketball and tennis for a few years, then I started playing the piano at 6. I kept playing it for 12 years until I became independent.
       Even today, between a study break and another I play the piano, but without consistency. Around the age of 16 I discovered the mountains and climbing and
       I fell in love with them. Being in contact with nature and perceiving the sense of discovery is what excited me the most and maybe that's why I decided to
       study physics. Someone said 'it is not the mountain we conquer but ourself'.
