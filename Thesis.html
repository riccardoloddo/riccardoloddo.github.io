        <p>Two galaxy clusters in the process of merging created a layer of surprisingly hot gas between them that University of Colorado Boulder astronomers believe is from turbulence caused by banging into each other at supersonic speeds.
The two clusters, which are coming together to create the larger galaxy cluster Abell 115, are located some 2.4 billion light years away. The turbulent area of hot gas sandwiched between the two clusters, which CU Boulder Professor Jack Burns likened to a wake behind a motorboat, is about 300 million degrees F. That is roughly three times as hot as the two smaller cluster cores and 10 times hotter than the core of the sun, said Burns, lead study author.</p>

        <p>VLA (Very Large Array) radio maps of powerful FR II radio jets in CygnusA (left) and the weak FRI jets in 3C 31 (right). The jets are launched and powered by a black hole feeding at the centre of a galaxy. (To get a sense of the immense scale of these objects, the tiny dot at the centre of the left image is the galaxy from which the FRII jet is launched). Lighter colours correspond to regions with strong radio emission, the darker colours correspond to regions with weak or no radio emission. Note that the colour scale used in these images is not the same and the FRII jets on the left emit significantly stronger radio emission compared to the FRI jets on the right. image credit: NRAO/AUI.</p>
